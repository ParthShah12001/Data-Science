In this project i have analysed and tried to creat a good model for predicting quality 
for some give features of wine i have used 5 algorithm and build 5 different models
1)Decision tree
2)Random forest
3)Support vector machine
4)k-Nearest Neighbor
5)Naive Bayes

after building different model i found Random forest model to be the promising one
with 92.65% accuracy
