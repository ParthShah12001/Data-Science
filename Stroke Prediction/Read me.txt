I have created a model with predicts if someone will have stroke with accuracy of 98.90%
I have visualized and tried to fnd the relations among the columns and in this 
code i have only kept those who had a impact on the output or had some or other 
relation with other column and deleted other columns and i have also not visualized 
them in this model
