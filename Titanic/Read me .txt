I have created a visulization of titanic dataset and tried to predict if the person
survived the horrific incident or not i tried to predict it using 
1)Logistic Regression
2)K-Nearest Neighbors
3)Decision Tree
4)Random Forest
5)Support Vector Machine

I got the heighest accuracy of 82% in Logistic Regression
